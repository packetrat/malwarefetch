# malwarefetch
A python script that takes urls from any csv column named "url" and retrieves the files from the web url, recording the filenames and associated urls to another csv. Intended for collecting malware samples from telemetry dumps.
This obviously works with any files, not just malware. But its primary use is for conducting research on malware samples detected in the wild hosted on websites and in CDNs.
